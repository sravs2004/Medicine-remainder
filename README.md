Abstract:

This project presents a responsive and visually engaging Health Tracker web application designed to promote user wellness and healthy lifestyle management. The interface, built using HTML and CSS, includes dynamic sections such as a homepage, sign-in, and sign-up pages, each enriched with background imagery and styled for user-friendliness. The homepage introduces the app’s purpose, while sign-in and sign-up features facilitate user interaction and data personalization. With a modern design aesthetic and intuitive layout, the Health Tracker aims to offer a seamless user experience and lay a foundation for future integration with real health tracking data, analytics, or APIs.
